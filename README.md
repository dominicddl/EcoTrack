## Before using the app

### Limitations
üîç 1. AI Accuracy & Dependence
	‚Ä¢	Limitation: Reliance on Google Gemini AI for waste classification may lead to incorrect or biased predictions, especially for unclear images.
	‚Ä¢	Impact: Users may get inaccurate rewards or feedback, reducing trust in the system.

‚öñÔ∏è 2. Verification Bottleneck
	‚Ä¢	Limitation: Waste report verifications may require human validation in some cases, especially for edge scenarios.
	‚Ä¢	Impact: Slows down the reward system and notification flow, reducing real-time effectiveness.

üîí 3. Web3Auth Adoption Barrier
	‚Ä¢	Limitation: Not all users (especially older or less tech-savvy ones) are comfortable with Web3 wallet-based authentication.
	‚Ä¢	Impact: Limits app accessibility and onboarding rate among the general population.


## Milestone 1 (Ideation)
### Motivation
EcoTrack aims to address these pain points by empowering both residents and municipal authorities with real-time data, actionable insights, and user-friendly tools to promote responsible waste disposal and recycling. It is designed to incentivize and streamline waste reporting and collection. Our goal is to create a community-driven approach to waste management, rewarding users for their eco-friendly
actions.

As a resident who recycles regularly, I want to track my recycling habits and see my progress, so I can stay motivated and improve my environmental impact.

As a busy user, I want to receive timely notifications about waste collection schedules and recycling drives, so I never miss important dates or opportunities to participate.

As a waste collector, I want to view optimized collection routes and real-time bin fill levels, so I can make my rounds more efficiently and avoid unnecessary trips.

As a municipal officer, I want to access analytics and reports on waste generation and recycling rates, so I can make informed decisions about resource allocation and public outreach.

As a community leader, I want to organize local clean-up events and track participation through the app, so I can foster greater community involvement.

As a user with limited technical skills, I want the app to have an intuitive interface and clear instructions, so I can be incentivised to use the app.

As a resident who sometimes forgets to sort waste properly, I want the app to provide educational content and AI-powered waste classification, so I can learn and improve my
sorting habits.

## Software Engineering Practices and Design 

### Software Engineering Practices 
**Primary Architecture: N-tier Architecture with MVC Pattern**

For EcoTrack (an environmental tracking application), we aim to implement a **3-tier layered architecture** combined with the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern:

```mermaid
graph TB
  subgraph PL[Presentation Layer]
    UI[User Interface]
    Controllers[Controllers]
  end
  subgraph BL[Business Logic Layer]
    Models[Models/Entities]
    Services[Business Services]
    Validators[Data Validators]
  end
  subgraph DAL[Data Access Layer]
    DAO[Data Access Objects]
    DB[(Database)]
    APIs[External APIs]
  end
  UI --> Controllers
  Controllers --> Services
  Controllers --> Models
  Services --> DAO
  DAO --> DB
  DAO --> APIs
```

## Design Patterns

### 1. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**
- **Models**: Represent environmental data (carbon footprint, energy usage, waste tracking)
- **Views**: User interfaces for data input/visualization 
- **Controllers**: Handle user interactions and coordinate between models and views

### 2. **Observer Pattern**
- Perfect for real-time environmental data updates
- Notify users when thresholds are exceeded (e.g., high carbon footprint)
- Update dashboards automatically when new data is added

### 3. **Command Pattern**
- Implement undo/redo functionality for data entry
- Track user actions for audit purposes
- Useful for batch operations (bulk data import/export)

### 4. **Factory Pattern**
- Create different types of environmental trackers (energy, transportation, waste)
- Generate appropriate calculators based on data type
- Support multiple calculation methodologies

### 5. **Strategy Pattern**
- Different calculation algorithms for carbon footprint
- Multiple data export formats (PDF, CSV, JSON)
- Various visualization types (charts, graphs, reports)
